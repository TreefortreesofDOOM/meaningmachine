JavaScript HTTP client for the Seam API written in TypeScript.

## Description

[Seam] makes it easy to integrate IoT devices with your applications.
This is an official SDK for the Seam API.
Please refer to the official [Seam Docs] to get started.

Parts of this SDK are generated from always up-to-date type information
provided by [@seamapi/types].
This ensures all API methods, request shapes, and response shapes are
accurate and fully typed.

The SDK contains minimal dependencies, is fully tree-shakeable,
and optimized for use in both client and server applications.
The underlying HTTP client is [Axios].

## Installation

_This is a low-level package meant for applications and libraries with particular dependency requirements.
Before using this package, ensure you understand the installation and updating instructions.
This SDK is entirely contained in the [seam package]. Seam recommends using that package instead
for simpler dependency management._

Add this as a dependency to your project using [npm] with

```
$ npm install @seamapi/http
```

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/
[seam package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/seam

### Optional Peer Dependencies for TypeScript

This package has optional peer dependencies for TypeScript users.
Recent versions of npm will automatically install peer dependencies by default.
For those users, no additional steps are necessary for full TypeScript support,
however users should still explicitly install the latest types (see the next section).

Other package managers require peer dependencies to be added manually.
Refer to any warnings generated by your package manager
about missing peer dependencies and install them as needed.
Refer to the next section for keeping the types updated.

#### Keeping up with the latest types

This package depends on [@seamapi/types] for the latest TypeScript types.
New versions of this SDK are generally not released when new types are published.
Unless your project frequently runs a blanket `npm update`,
the types will become outdated with the Seam API over time.
Thus, users of this package should explicitly install the types with

```
$ npm install -D @seamapi/types
```

and update them when consuming new API features with

```
$ npm install -D @seamapi/types@latest
```

## Usage

### Examples

_These examples assume `SEAM_API_KEY` is set in your environment._

#### List devices

```ts
import { SeamHttp } from '@seamapi/http/connect'

const seam = new SeamHttp()
const devices = await seam.devices.list()
```

#### Unlock a door

```ts
import { SeamHttp } from '@seamapi/http/connect'

const seam = new SeamHttp()
const lock = await seam.locks.get({ name: 'Front Door' })
await seam.locks.unlockDoor({ device_id: lock.device_id })
```

### Authentication Methods

The SDK supports several authentication mechanisms.
Authentication may be configured by passing the corresponding
options directly to the `SeamHttp` constructor,
or with the more ergonomic static factory methods.

> Publishable Key authentication is not supported by the constructor
> and must be configured using `SeamHttp.fromPublishableKey`.

#### API Key

An API key is scoped to a single workspace and should only be used on the server.
Obtain one from the Seam Console.

```ts
// Set the `SEAM_API_KEY` environment variable
const seam = new SeamHttp()

// Pass as the first argument to the constructor
const seam = new SeamHttp('your-api-key')

// Pass as an option the constructor
const seam = new SeamHttp({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' })

// Use the factory method
const seam = SeamHttp.fromApiKey('your-api-key')
```

#### Client Session Token

A Client Session Token is scoped to a client session and should only be used on the client.

```ts
// Pass as an option the constructor
const seam = new SeamHttp({ clientSessionToken: 'some-client-session-token' })

// Use the factory method
const seam = SeamHttp.fromClientSessionToken('some-client-session-token')
```

The client session token may be updated using

```ts
const seam = SeamHttp.fromClientSessionToken('some-client-session-token')

await seam.updateClientSessionToken('some-new-client-session-token')
```

#### Publishable Key

A Publishable Key is used by the client to acquire Client Session Token for a workspace.
Obtain one from the Seam Console.

Use the async factory method to return a client authenticated with a client session token:

```ts
const seam = await SeamHttp.fromPublishableKey(
  'your-publishable-key',
  'some-user-identifier-key',
)
```

This will get an existing client session matching the user identifier key,
or create a new empty client session.

#### Personal Access Token

A Personal Access Token is scoped to a Seam Console user.
Obtain one from the Seam Console.
A workspace id must be provided when using this method
and all requests will be scoped to that workspace.

```ts
// Pass as an option the constructor

const seam = new SeamHttp({
  personalAccessToken: 'your-personal-access-token',
  workspaceId: 'your-workspace-id',
})

// Use the factory method
const seam = SeamHttp.fromPersonalAccessToken(
  'some-console-session-token',
  'your-workspace-id',
)
```

#### Console Session Token

A Console Session Token is used by the Seam Console.
This authentication method is only used by internal Seam applications.
A workspace id must be provided when using this method
and all requests will be scoped to that workspace.

```ts
// Pass as an option the constructor
const seam = new SeamHttp({
  consoleSessionToken: 'some-console-session-token',
  workspaceId: 'your-workspace-id',
})

// Use the factory method
const seam = SeamHttp.fromConsoleSessionToken(
  'some-console-session-token',
  'your-workspace-id',
)
```

### Action Attempts

Some asynchronous operations, e.g., unlocking a door, return an [action attempt].
Seam tracks the progress of requested operation and updates the action attempt.

To make working with action attempts more convenient for applications,
this library provides the `waitForActionAttempt` option.

Pass the option per-request,

```ts
await seam.locks.unlockDoor(
  { device_id },
  {
    waitForActionAttempt: true,
  },
)
```

or set the default option for the client:

```ts
const seam = new SeamHttp({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  waitForActionAttempt: true,
})

await seam.locks.unlockDoor({ device_id })
```

If you have already have an action attempt id
and want to wait for it to resolve, simply use

```ts
await seam.actionAttempts.get(
  { action_attempt_id },
  {
    waitForActionAttempt: true,
  },
)
```

Using the `waitForActionAttempt` option:

- Polls the action attempt up to the `timeout`
  at the `pollingInterval` (both in milliseconds).
- Resolves with a fresh copy of the successful action attempt.
- Rejects with a `SeamActionAttemptFailedError` if the action attempt is unsuccessful.
- Rejects with a `SeamActionAttemptTimeoutError` if the action attempt is still pending when the `timeout` is reached.
- Both errors expose an `actionAttempt` property.

```ts
import {
  SeamHttp,
  isSeamActionAttemptFailedError,
  isSeamActionAttemptTimeoutError,
} from '@seamapi/http/connect'

const seam = new SeamHttp('your-api-key')

const [lock] = await seam.locks.list()

if (lock == null) throw new Error('No locks in this workspace')

try {
  await seam.locks.unlockDoor(
    { device_id: lock.device_id },
    {
      waitForActionAttempt: {
        pollingInterval: 1000,
        timeout: 5000,
      },
    },
  )
  console.log('Door unlocked')
} catch (err: unknown) {
  if (isSeamActionAttemptFailedError(err)) {
    console.log('Could not unlock the door')
    return
  }

  if (isSeamActionAttemptTimeoutError(err)) {
    console.log('Door took too long to unlock')
    return
  }

  throw err
}
```

### Interacting with Multiple Workspaces

Some Seam API endpoints interact with multiple workspaces.
The `SeamHttpMultiWorkspace` client is not bound to a specific workspace
and may use those endpoints with an appropriate authentication method.

#### Personal Access Token

A Personal Access Token is scoped to a Seam Console user.
Obtain one from the Seam Console.

```ts
// Pass as an option the constructor
const seam = new SeamHttpMultiWorkspace({
  personalAccessToken: 'your-personal-access-token',
})

// Use the factory method
const seam = SeamHttpMultiWorkspace.fromPersonalAccessToken(
  'some-console-session-token',
)

// List workspaces authorized for this Personal Access Token
const workspaces = await seam.workspaces.list()
```

#### Console Session Token

A Console Session Token is used by the Seam Console.
This authentication method is only used by internal Seam applications.

```ts
// Pass as an option the constructor
const seam = new SeamHttpMultiWorkspace({
  consoleSessionToken: 'some-console-session-token',
})

// Use the factory method
const seam = SeamHttpMultiWorkspace.fromConsoleSessionToken(
  'some-console-session-token',
)

// List workspaces authorized for this Seam Console user
const workspaces = await seam.workspaces.list()
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Additional Options

In addition the various authentication options,
the constructor takes some advanced options that affect behavior.

```ts
const seam = new SeamHttp({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  endpoint: 'https://example.com',
  axiosOptions: {},
  axiosRetryOptions: {},
})
```

When using the static factory methods,
these options may be passed in as the last argument.

```ts
const seam = SeamHttp.fromApiKey('some-api-key', {
  endpoint: 'https://example.com',
  axiosOptions: {},
  axiosRetryOptions: {},
})
```

#### Setting the endpoint

Some contexts may need to override the API endpoint,
e.g., testing or proxy setups.
This option corresponds to the Axios `baseURL` setting.

Either pass the `endpoint` option, or set the `SEAM_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

#### Configuring the Axios Client

The Axios client and retry behavior may be configured with custom initiation options
via [`axiosOptions`][axiosOptions] and [`axiosRetryOptions`][axiosRetryOptions].
Options are deep merged with the default options.

[axiosOptions]: https://axios-http.com/docs/config_defaults
[axiosRetryOptions]: https://github.com/softonic/axios-retry

#### Using the Axios Client

The Axios client is exposed and may be used or configured directly:

```ts
import { SeamHttp, DevicesListResponse } from '@seamapi/http/connect'

const seam = new SeamHttp()

seam.client.interceptors.response.use((response) => {
  console.log(response)
  return response
})

const devices = await seam.client.get<DevicesListResponse>('/devices/list')
```

#### Overriding the Client

An Axios compatible client may be provided to create a `SeamHttp` instance.
This API is used internally and is not directly supported.

#### Inspecting the Request

All client methods return an instance of `SeamHttpRequest`.
Inspect the request before it is sent to the server by intentionally not awaiting the `SeamHttpRequest`:

```ts
const seam = new SeamHttp('your-api-key')

const request = seam.devices.list()

console.log(`${request.method} ${request.url}`, JSON.stringify(request.body))

const devices = await request.execute()
```
